                <h2><b>Life of Engineering Student !!></b></h2>
                <br>
                 Engineers are people who solve problems and focus on making things work more in easy way. They apply the theories and principles of science and mathematics to research and develop economical solutions to technical problems. That is the definition of an Engineer. Agreed. 
                 But who are the engineering students? They are often the ones who are overburdened with their assignments, deprived of sleep, low on social life (maybe) and busy in their own world of movies and series. 
                 In this blog, tried to compile, in pictures, what all engineering students go through.
                 In engineering colleges, everyone is competing in the race of securing the highest grade points and even a percent matters.
                  Hence, they have no option but to do those long assignments worth just that one percent.</p>
